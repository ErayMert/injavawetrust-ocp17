# Initializing Variables

## Creating Local Variables

A local variable is a variable defined within a constructor, method, or initializer block.

### Final Local Variables

The final keyword can be applied to local variables and is equivalent to declaring constants in other languages.

```
final int y = 10;
int x = 20;
y = x + 10; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

The final modifier can also be applied to local variable references.

```
final int[] favoriteNumbers = new int[10];
favoriteNumbers[0] = 10;
favoriteNumbers[1] = 20;
favoriteNumbers = null; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

Notice that we can modify the content, or data, in the array.

### Uninitialized Local Variables

Local variables do not have a default value and must be initialized before use. Furthermore, the compiler will report an
error if you try to read an uninitialized value

```
public int notValid() {
    int y = 10;
    int x;
    int reply = x + y; // DOES NOT COMPILE 
    return reply;
}
```

The compiler is smart enough to recognize variables that have been initialized after their declaration but before they
are used.

```
public int valid() {
    int y = 10;
    int x; // x is declared here
    x = 3; // x is initialized here
    int z; // z is declared here but never initialized or used

    int reply = x + y;
    return reply;
}
```

The compiler is also smart enough to recognize initializations that are more complex. In this example, there are two
branches of code:

## Passing Constructor and Method Parameters

Variables passed to a constructor or method are called constructor parameters or method parameters, respectively.

```
public void findAnswer(boolean check) {
}
public void checkAnswer() {
    boolean value;
    findAnswer(value); // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

The call to findAnswer() does not compile because it tries to use a variable that is not initialized.

## Defining Instance and Class Variables

An instance variable, often called a field, is a value defined within a specific instance of an object.

On the other hand, a class variable is one that is defined on the class level and shared among all instances of the
class.

Instance and class variables do not require you to initialize them. As soon as you declare these variables, they are
given a default value.
The compiler doesn’t know what value to use and so wants the simplest value it can give the type: null for an object,
zero for the numeric types, and false for a boolean. You don’t need to know the default value for char, but in case you
are curious, it is '\u0000' (NUL).
