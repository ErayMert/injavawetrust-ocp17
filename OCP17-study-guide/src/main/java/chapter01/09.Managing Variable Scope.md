# Managing Variable Scope

## Limiting Scope

Local variables can never have a scope larger than the method they are defined in.

```
   public void eatIfHungry(boolean hungry) {
        if (hungry) {
            int bitesOfCheese = 1;
        } // bitesOfCheese goes out of scope here

        System.out.println(bitesOfCheese); // DOES NOT COMPILE
    }
```

Remember that blocks can contain other blocks. These smaller contained blocks can ref- erence variables defined in the
larger scoped blocks, but not vice versa.

```
    public void eatIfHungry(boolean hungry) {
        if (hungry) {
            int bitesOfCheese = 1;
            {
                var teenyBit = true;
                System.out.println(bitesOfCheese);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(teenyBit); // DOES NOT COMPILE
    }
```

## Tracing Scope

The exam will attempt to trick you with various questions on scope.

## Applying Scope to Classes

The rule for instance variables is easier: they are available as soon as they are defined and last for the entire
lifetime of the object itself. The rule for class, aka static, variables is even easier: they go into scope when
declared like the other variable types. However, they stay in scope for the entire life of the program.

## Reviewing Scope

- Local Variables :In scope from declaration to the end of the block.
- Method parameters: In scope for the duration of the method.
- Instance variables: In scope from declaration until the object is eligible for garbage collection.
- Class variables: In scope from declaration until the program ends
