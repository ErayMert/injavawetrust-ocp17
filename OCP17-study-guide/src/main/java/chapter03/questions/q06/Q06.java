//    Which statements about decision structures are true? (Choose all that apply.)

//    A. A for-each loop can be executed on any Collections Framework object.
//    B. The body of a while loop is guaranteed to be executed at least once.
// ++   C. The conditional expression of a for loop is evaluated before the first execution of the loop body.
// ++   D. A switch expression that takes a String and assigns the result to a variable requires a default branch.
// ++   E. The body of a do/while loop is guaranteed to be executed at least once.
//    F. An if statement can have multiple corresponding else statements.
//


    // A for-each loop can be executed on any Collections object that implements java.lang.Iterable

    // The body of a do/while loop is executed one or more times,
    // while the body of a while loop is executed zero or more times.

    // The conditional expression of for loops is evaluated at the start of the
    //loop execution, meaning the for loop may execute zero or more times

    // A switch expression that takes a String requires a default branch if the result is assigned to a variable.
