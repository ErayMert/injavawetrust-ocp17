    Most of the time, a switch expression returns a value, although printSeason() demonstrates one in which the return type is void.
    Since the type is void, it canâ€™t be assigned to a variable.
    On the exam, you are more likely to see a switch expression that returns a value, but you should be aware that it is possible.
