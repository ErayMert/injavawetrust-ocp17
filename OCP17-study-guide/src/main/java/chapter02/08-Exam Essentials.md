# Exam Essentials

**Be able to write code that uses Java operators.**

This chapter covered a wide variety of operator symbols.

**Be able to recognize which operators are associated with which data types.**

Some operators may be applied only to numeric primitives, some only to boolean values, and some only to objects.

**Understand when casting is required or numeric promotion occurs.**

Whenever you mix operands of two different data types, the compiler needs to decide how to handle the resulting data
type. When youâ€™re converting from a smaller to a larger data type, numeric promotion is automatically applied

**Understand Java operator precedence.**

You must understand the order in which Java will evaluate each operator symbol.

**Be able to write code that uses parentheses to override operator precedence.**

You can use parentheses in your code to manually change the order of precedence.
