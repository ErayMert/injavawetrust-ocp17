        // we ask Java to remove four whitespace characters from the same three lines.
        // Since there are not four whitespace characters, Java does its best.
        // The single space is removed before a and c.
        // Both spaces are removed before b. The length of six should make sense here; we removed one more character here

        System.out.println(concat.stripIndent().length()); // 6

        // All of the lines have at least one whitespace character.
        // Since they do not all have two whitespace characters,
        // the method only gets rid of one character per line.
        // Since no new line is added by stripIndent(), the length is six, which is three less than the original nine.
